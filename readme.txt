We automatically identify users that are logged in to your WordPress site, and records their `name`, `email`, `username`, and `website`, so you don't need to write any special code to handle that yourself. It also identifies commenters if it can.

We automatically record the different types of WordPress pages your users can visit. Things like "View About Page", "View Post", "View Author Page", etc. So you don't have to worry about recording them yourself. Just by enabling the plugin you'll already be recording all of those actions.
